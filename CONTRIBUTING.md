   ```
6. Push your branch to your fork:

7. Open a Pull Request (PR) from your fork/branch to `main` (or the repository's default branch).

## PR guidelines
- Use a concise title and a detailed description.
- Reference any related issue using `#<issue-number>`.
- If your change affects code, add or update tests where appropriate.
- Keep PRs focused and small when possible — one logical change per PR.
- Be responsive to reviewer suggestions and update your PR as requested.

## Coding standards
- Keep code readable and well-commented.
- Follow existing project style and conventions.
- If adding code, include meaningful variable/function names and maintain consistent indentation.
- For documentation: use clear English and proofread for typos.

## File/Content contributions
- For adding images or assets, place them in the appropriate directory and reference them relatively.
- For new examples, add an explanatory README or comments in the file to explain usage.

## Reporting issues
- Before opening a new issue, search existing issues and PRs to avoid duplicates.
- When creating an issue include:
  - A clear title.
  - Steps to reproduce (if applicable).
  - Expected vs actual behavior.
  - Environment details (OS, browser, versions) when relevant.
  - Screenshots or logs if helpful.

## Hacktoberfest participation
- If your contribution is meant for Hacktoberfest, request the `hacktoberfest-accepted` label in the PR or ask a repository maintainer to add it once the PR meets contribution guidelines.
- Maintainers: please ensure only valid contributions receive the label.

## Code of Conduct
Please be respectful and constructive in interactions. Maintainers and contributors are expected to follow the project's code of conduct.

## Thank you
